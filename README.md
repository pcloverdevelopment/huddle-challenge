# Huddle Landing Page with Signle Introductory Section

## This is one of the challenges from frontendmentor.io!

I purchase a sketch design from Frontend Mentor to work on my frontend
skills. It has all of the specs for the page for mobile and desktop design
along with all of the necessary assets.

Check out the FrontendMentorReadMe.md file to get a sense of what is given
to me out of the box.
